		<i> A: 'Sandbox User' is a special user used to let people get a quick look at what an annotated PDF looks like in NB. But in order to really use NB, you need to be logged in as yourself. So logout by chooing "Log out" from the top right menu, or visiting the /logout URL (e.g. <a class="link" href="http://nb.mit.edu/logout">nb.mit.edu/logout</a> if you're using the <a class="link" href="http://nb.mit.edu">nb.mit.edu</a> server for instance), and re-login as yourself. </i>

	<ul>
	<li> <b> <span id="memberq1A"> Q: How do I get access to contents from a class on NB? </span> </b> </li>
		<i> A: It depends on that class settings:
		<ul>
		<li> If the class is "by invitation only", you need to contact to the class administrator (i.e. the instructor or the TA in most cases) and ask them for an invitation. </li>
		<li> If the class provides a "subscribe link", you just need to enter that "subscribe link" on your browser and confirm that you want to be part of that class on NB. </li>
		<li> If the class material is viewable by the whole world you don't even need an account on NB: You just need to visit the URL of any of that class (it looks like http://[SERVER_NAME]/f/[SOME_NUMBER], for example <a class="link" href="http://ocw.csail.mit.edu/f/1">http://ocw.csail.mit.edu/f/1</a>) </li>

		<li> There are 3 visiblility settings for your notes:
	  		<ul>
	    		<li> <b>The Entire Class</b>, meaning that those notes can be seen by both students and staff. </li>
	    		<li> <b>Staff only</b>, meaning those notes can be seen by the staff. Note that some NB sites might not allow <b>Staff Only</b> notes.</li>
	    		<li> <b>Myself only</b> notes are private:  Staff and other students can't see them </li>
	  		</ul>
		</li>

	<ul>
	<li> <b> <span id="researchq1A"> Q: Can I use NB for my research in online educational tools? </span> </b> </li>
		<i> A: Of course! NB was initially developed for research purposes, and was made open-source under a MIT licence so that it can be used and modified in order not to have to reinvent the wheel if you need to deploy an annotation tool. A paper about how students and faculty used NB has been published to CHI 2012: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2207676.2208326 Authors' copy is available at http://groups.csail.mit.edu/haystack/documents/papers/2012/nb_chi2012.pdf </i>
	<li> <b> <span id="researchq2A"> Q: Is it possible to download the annotated PDFs? </span> </b> </li>
		<i> A: It's possible to download the annotated PDF if you have admin rights to the NB class that contains that PDF. </i>
