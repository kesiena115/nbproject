This entire folder was copied from https://github.com/eugena/django-remote-forms

This was done because for some unknown reason, there was a bug when I tried downloading the package from github using pip.

I copied the version from "eugena/django-remote-forms" github repo instead of the original version from "WiserTogether/django-remote-forms" because eugena implemented a relevant bug fix and her pull request has been pending for almost a year.
